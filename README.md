# PyLispSICP
A Lisp interpreter written in Python for MIT's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition", written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, & Julie Sussman.

I've been going through SICP in my freetime, and becoming very interested in the language of Lisp I decided to code my own interpreter to complete the exercises and examples provided by the book.  I started coding an interpreter for Common Lisp myself and only after I had finished did I find Peter Norvig's Lis.py scheme interpreter; however, upon review I found my code actually wasn't too different from his and just made some minor improvements.

Status: PyLisp Interpreter is still a WIP, but supports functions, math, boolean logic, and evaluation. See bottom of `.py` files in the `pylisp` directory for example usages.
