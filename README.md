# SICP_Python_Translation
A Python translation of the (retired) MIT Computer Science book, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition", written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, & Julie Sussman.


I am currently reading SICP, and  am translating some of the code segments and pages into Python.
