# SICP_Python_Translation
A Python translation of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition", a book written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, & Julie Sussman.
I am currently reading SICP, and as I'm going through it I am translating some ofthe code segments pages into Python code and terms.
