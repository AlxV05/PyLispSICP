# SICPPythonTranslation
A Python translation of the (retired) MIT Computer Science book, "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition", written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, & Julie Sussman.


I am currently reading SICP, and am translating some of the Lisp code segments and pages into Python. I've also re-created some of the Lisp structures like pairs in Python, as well as some of the methods used with them. I've used these to write Lisp-ish code for the exercises in SICP.
