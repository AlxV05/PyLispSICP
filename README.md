# SICP_Python_Translation
A Python translation of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Second Edition", a book written by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, & Julie Sussman.
I take no credit the majority of the writing in this project. All I have done is translate the original Lisp code, and its corresponding text, from the book, into Python terms.
